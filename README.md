# switch-word-game

### Unfinished (barely started) concept for a game to learn languages

A concept of an educational game where you insert a phrase, sentence or paragraph in one language into a textarea and then that same text is shown twice more (below or next to it). Then in the middle one copy you click on any word to see an input for the translation. As you type in translations for more and more words more and more words in the last text block become clickable, allowing to switch their language back and forth.

The idea is to learn to read the foreign language with less and less words translated or with some random number of words translated. The game is not meant to be competitive or to be a translation tool, but rather a way to learn the language.
